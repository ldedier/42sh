When a process in a background job tries to read from its controlling terminal,
the process group is usually sent a SIGTTIN signal.
This normally causes all of the processes in that group to stop
(unless they handle the signal and donâ€™t stop themselves).
However, if the reading process is ignoring or blocking this signal,
then read fails with an EIO error instead.
